# Feature Specification: rwMarkable Application Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `001-rwmarkable-setup`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to set up a new docker application called rwmarkable in portainer. The repo for the app is available at: https://github.com/fccview/rwMarkable. update the portainer to include this app. Also create a new dns record in external records for rw.ketwork.in which we will use to access this app from the internet."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: Should the DNS record for rw.ketwork.in be proxied through Cloudflare (enabling CDN/DDoS protection) or use a direct connection? ‚Üí A: Proxied through Cloudflare
- Q: What is the target IP address for the rw.ketwork.in DNS record? ‚Üí A: 15.235.186.122 (same as other external services)
- Q: What authentication/access control should rwMarkable enforce? ‚Üí A: Application's built-in user management and authentication
- Q: What is the persistent storage path for rwMarkable data? ‚Üí A: ${docker_config_path}/rwmarkable
- Q: Should resource limits (CPU/memory) be applied to the rwMarkable container? ‚Üí A: Match existing stacks pattern from similar apps

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want to deploy the rwMarkable application (a self-hosted checklist and note-taking tool) to my infrastructure so that users can access it via a custom domain for managing tasks and notes with their data stored on our own server.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the rwMarkable application is deployed, **When** a user navigates to rw.ketwork.in, **Then** the rwMarkable web interface loads successfully
2. **Given** the DNS configuration is complete, **When** an external user resolves rw.ketwork.in, **Then** the DNS returns the correct IP address (15.235.186.122)
3. **Given** the application container is running, **When** a user creates a checklist or note, **Then** the data persists and is available on subsequent visits
4. **Given** the application is deployed via Portainer, **When** the container needs to be restarted or updated, **Then** the changes can be managed through the Portainer interface
5. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** a user attempts to access rwMarkable, **Then** they are authenticated via the application's built-in user management system

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the DNS record is updated but the application is not yet running?
- How does the system handle container failures or restarts?
- What happens if users attempt to access the application before DNS propagation completes?
- How does the system handle user account creation and password reset flows?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Infrastructure MUST deploy rwMarkable as a containerized application accessible to end users
- **FR-002**: Infrastructure MUST create a DNS A record mapping rw.ketwork.in to IP address 15.235.186.122
- **FR-003**: Application MUST be manageable through Portainer alongside existing container deployments
- **FR-004**: Application MUST persist user data (checklists, notes, preferences) across container restarts
- **FR-005**: Application MUST be accessible via the custom domain rw.ketwork.in from the internet
- **FR-006**: DNS record MUST be proxied through Cloudflare for CDN and DDoS protection
- **FR-007**: Application MUST be deployed with resource limits matching existing stack patterns
- **FR-008**: Application MUST authenticate users via its built-in user management and authentication system
- **FR-009**: Application data MUST be stored in persistent volume following the docker_config_path pattern
- **FR-010**: DNS record MUST follow existing external record configuration (TTL and proxy settings)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Container restart policy MUST ensure automatic recovery from failures
- **NFR-002**: Data persistence MUST survive container updates and restarts
- **NFR-003**: DNS changes MUST propagate according to Cloudflare's standard TTL policies
- **NFR-004**: User credentials and authentication data MUST persist across container restarts

### Key Entities
- **Container Stack**: Deployment configuration for rwMarkable application including image source, port mappings, volume mounts, and environment variables
- **DNS Record**: A record entry mapping the subdomain rw.ketwork.in to IP 15.235.186.122 with Cloudflare proxy enabled
- **Persistent Storage**: Volume mount location using docker_config_path pattern for storing application data (checklists, notes, user preferences, themes, user credentials)

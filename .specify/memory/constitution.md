# Terraform Infrastructure Constitution

This document establishes the fundamental principles governing development practices, quality standards, and operational requirements for this Terraform infrastructure project.

## Article I: Code Quality Principles

### Section 1: Code Standards
- **Consistency**: All Terraform code MUST be `terraform fmt` compliant before commit
- **Clarity**: Use descriptive resource names and comprehensive comments explaining purpose
- **Modularity**: Organize code into focused modules with clear responsibilities
- **Version Control**: Pin all provider versions explicitly to ensure reproducible deployments

**Rationale**: Consistent standards ensure maintainable, readable infrastructure code that can be safely modified by any team member.

### Section 2: Code Organization
- **File Structure**: Maintain purpose-driven file organization (variables.tf, outputs.tf, main.tf)
- **Naming Conventions**: Use snake_case for all Terraform identifiers (variables, resources, outputs)
- **Documentation**: All input variables MUST include descriptions and type constraints
- **Separation of Concerns**: Isolate provider configurations within dedicated module directories

**Rationale**: Organized code structure reduces cognitive load and enables efficient collaboration across team members.

### Section 3: Configuration Management
- **No Hardcoding**: Prefer variables or locals over hardcoded values
- **Environment Separation**: Use Terraform workspaces for environment isolation (dev, staging, prod)
- **State Management**: Implement remote state backends with state locking for team collaboration
- **Resource Lifecycle**: Use appropriate lifecycle rules for critical resources

**Rationale**: Proper configuration management prevents environment drift and enables safe multi-environment deployments.

## Article II: Testing Standards

### Section 1: Validation Requirements
- **Syntax Validation**: Run `terraform validate` before any deployment
- **Plan Review**: Execute `terraform plan` and review all changes before applying
- **Format Verification**: Ensure `terraform fmt` passes in CI/CD pipelines
- **Security Scanning**: Implement automated security scanning for Terraform configurations

**Rationale**: Comprehensive validation prevents deployment failures and security vulnerabilities in production environments.

### Section 2: Testing Workflow
- **Required Sequence**: Format → Validate → Plan → Apply (never skip steps)
- **Peer Review**: All infrastructure changes require code review before merge
- **Testing Environments**: Test all changes in non-production environments first
- **Rollback Plans**: Maintain documented rollback procedures for all deployments

**Rationale**: Systematic testing workflow minimizes production incidents and ensures change visibility.

### Section 3: Quality Assurance
- **Automated Checks**: Implement pre-commit hooks for formatting and validation
- **Integration Testing**: Verify infrastructure functionality after deployment
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure configurations meet security and compliance requirements
- **Documentation Testing**: Validate that documentation matches actual implementation

**Rationale**: Quality assurance processes catch issues early and maintain system reliability.

## Article III: User Experience Consistency

### Section 1: Interface Standards
- **Predictable Patterns**: Use consistent variable naming and module interfaces across all components
- **Clear Documentation**: Provide comprehensive usage examples and module documentation
- **Error Handling**: Implement meaningful error messages and validation rules
- **Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults for optional variables

**Rationale**: Consistent interfaces reduce learning curve and prevent configuration errors.

### Section 2: Operational Consistency
- **Deployment Patterns**: Standardize deployment workflows across all environments
- **Monitoring Integration**: Ensure all deployed resources include appropriate monitoring and alerting
- **Tagging Strategy**: Implement consistent resource tagging for cost allocation and management
- **Access Patterns**: Maintain consistent authentication and authorization approaches

**Rationale**: Operational consistency enables predictable system behavior and efficient troubleshooting.

### Section 3: Developer Experience
- **Local Development**: Provide clear setup instructions for local development environments
- **IDE Integration**: Support modern IDE features with proper Terraform formatting and validation
- **Troubleshooting**: Maintain comprehensive troubleshooting guides and common issue resolutions
- **Onboarding**: Ensure new team members can productively contribute within their first day

**Rationale**: Superior developer experience improves team productivity and reduces time-to-contribution.

## Article IV: Performance Requirements

### Section 1: Infrastructure Performance
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-size all infrastructure resources based on actual usage patterns
- **Cost Efficiency**: Implement cost optimization strategies and regular cost reviews
- **Scalability**: Design all infrastructure to handle anticipated growth and load patterns
- **Availability**: Target appropriate availability levels based on service criticality

**Rationale**: Performance optimization ensures cost-effective operations and reliable service delivery.

### Section 2: Deployment Performance
- **Plan Execution Time**: Terraform plans should complete within 5 minutes for standard changes
- **Apply Duration**: Infrastructure deployments should complete within 15 minutes for typical changes
- **State Operations**: Terraform state operations should complete within 30 seconds
- **Provider Efficiency**: Optimize provider configurations to minimize API calls and rate limiting

**Rationale**: Fast deployment cycles enable rapid iteration and reduce developer waiting time.

### Section 3: Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics Collection**: Implement comprehensive infrastructure metrics collection
- **Performance Baselines**: Establish and maintain performance baselines for all critical services
- **Alerting Thresholds**: Configure proactive alerting for performance degradation
- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct monthly performance reviews and optimization sessions

**Rationale**: Proactive monitoring prevents issues and enables continuous performance improvement.

## Article V: Security and Compliance

### Section 1: Security Fundamentals
- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets to version control; use external secret managers
- **Least Privilege**: Apply principle of least privilege to all access controls
- **Sensitive Variables**: Mark all sensitive variables with `sensitive = true`
- **Encryption**: Ensure encryption at rest and in transit for all sensitive data

**Rationale**: Security fundamentals protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to critical infrastructure.

### Section 2: Compliance Requirements
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs for all infrastructure changes
- **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls for all infrastructure components
- **Data Protection**: Ensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations
- **Regular Assessments**: Conduct quarterly security assessments and vulnerability scans

**Rationale**: Compliance requirements ensure regulatory adherence and reduce legal and business risks.

## Article VI: Human Control and Authorization

### Section 1: Manual Execution Requirements
- **No Automated Apply**: Automation tools MUST NOT execute `terraform apply` automatically
- **User Confirmation**: All infrastructure changes require explicit manual execution by authorized users
- **Plan Review Mandate**: Users MUST review `terraform plan` output before applying changes
- **Manual Git Operations**: Automation tools MUST NOT execute git commit, merge, or push operations

**Rationale**: Human oversight prevents unintended infrastructure changes and maintains accountability for critical operations.

### Section 2: Instruction Protocol
- **User Direction**: When changes are ready, instruct users to run commands manually
- **Command Specification**: Provide exact commands for users to execute
- **Review Emphasis**: Remind users to review all changes before execution
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Break down complex operations into clear manual steps

**Rationale**: Clear instructions ensure proper execution while maintaining human control over critical operations.

### Section 3: Safety Mechanisms
- **Human Gate**: Maintain human oversight for all critical infrastructure operations
- **Audit Requirements**: All manual executions must be logged and attributable
- **Exception Prohibition**: No exceptions to manual execution requirements for apply/commit operations
- **Training Requirement**: Users must understand implications before executing provided commands

**Rationale**: Safety mechanisms prevent accidents and ensure all changes are traceable to responsible individuals.

## Article VII: Enforcement and Governance

### Section 1: Enforcement Mechanisms
- **Automated Validation**: Implement CI/CD pipeline checks to enforce standards
- **Code Review Requirements**: All changes require approval from designated reviewers
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regular automated compliance checks and reporting
- **Exception Process**: Defined process for requesting exceptions with proper justification

**Rationale**: Enforcement mechanisms ensure constitutional compliance and maintain system integrity.

### Section 2: Continuous Improvement
- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly constitution reviews to ensure relevance and effectiveness
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate team feedback and lessons learned into updates
- **Metric-Driven Decisions**: Use quantitative metrics to guide constitutional amendments
- **Industry Standards**: Align with evolving industry best practices and standards

**Rationale**: Continuous improvement ensures the constitution remains effective and relevant as the project evolves.
